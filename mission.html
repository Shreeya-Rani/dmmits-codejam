        Chandrayaan 3 is the third lunar exploration mission planned by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is a follow-up mission to Chandrayaan 2, which aimed to land a rover on the Moon's surface but encountered a technical issue during the landing phase. Chandrayaan 3 is expected to include a lander and a rover, with the goal of furthering our understanding of the Moon's surface and its composition. The mission is part of India's ongoing efforts to explore and study the Moon.

        Chandrayaan 3 is the third lunar exploration mission planned by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is a follow-up mission to Chandrayaan 2, which was launched in July 2019. Chandrayaan 2 aimed to land a rover on the Moon's surface, but unfortunately, the lander Vikram encountered a technical issue during the landing phase and the mission did not achieve a soft landing.
 <br>
Chandrayaan 3 is being developed to rectify the issues faced during Chandrayaan 2 and to continue India's exploration of the Moon. The mission is expected to consist of a lander and a rover, similar to its predecessor. The primary objective of Chandrayaan 3 is to further our understanding of the Moon's surface, its composition, and its evolution.

        The lander and rover of Chandrayaan 3 will be designed to perform scientific experiments and collect data about the lunar surface. This data will help scientists gain insights into the Moon's geology, mineralogy, and the presence of water ice, among other aspects. The mission will also contribute to the global scientific community's knowledge of the Moon and its significance in planetary studies.
<br>
ISRO is working on refining the design and addressing the technical challenges faced during Chandrayaan 2 to ensure a successful landing and mission completion for Chandrayaan 3. The exact timeline for the launch of Chandrayaan 3 has not been announced yet, but it is expected to take place in the near future.
