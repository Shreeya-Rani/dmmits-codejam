        Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also known as Mangalyaan, which was a mission conducted by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to study Mars.

The Mars Orbiter Mission was launched on November 5, 2013, and successfully entered Mars' orbit on September 24, 2014. The primary objective of the mission was to demonstrate India's technological capabilities in interplanetary space exploration and to study the Martian atmosphere, surface features, and mineralogy.

        The Mars Orbiter Mission carried a suite of scientific instruments onboard, including a camera, a thermal infrared spectrometer, a methane sensor, and a particle environment monitor. These instruments were designed to gather data about Mars' atmosphere, weather patterns, surface composition, and the presence of methane, which could indicate the possibility of past or present microbial life.

        The mission achieved several significant milestones, including the successful insertion into Mars' orbit using the spacecraft's propulsion system. It also demonstrated India's ability to plan and execute complex interplanetary missions on a relatively low budget.

The Mars Orbiter Mission provided valuable data and insights into Mars' atmosphere and surface, contributing to our understanding of the Red Planet. It also served as a technological stepping stone for future interplanetary missions by ISRO.
