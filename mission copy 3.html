        Aryabhata was India's first satellite, named after the ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer, Aryabhata. It was launched on April 19, 1975.<br>
The Aryabhata satellite was designed to conduct scientific experiments in space and gather data on various aspects of Earth's atmosphere and cosmic radiation. It had a mass of around 360 kilograms and was placed in a near-Earth orbit at an altitude of approximately 600 kilometers.
<br>
The primary objectives of the Aryabhata satellite were to study the Earth's ionosphere, measure solar X-rays and gamma rays, and investigate the behavior of cosmic rays. It carried several scientific instruments, including X-ray detectors, a gamma-ray spectrometer, and a microwave radiometer.

        One of the notable achievements of the Aryabhata satellite was the successful measurement of solar X-rays and gamma rays, which provided valuable insights into the Sun's emissions and their impact on Earth's atmosphere. It also conducted experiments to study the Earth's magnetic field and its interaction with cosmic rays.
<br>
        The mission of Aryabhata lasted for about six months, during which it transmitted a wealth of scientific data back to Earth. The satellite played a crucial role in establishing India's presence in space exploration and laid the foundation for future space missions by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
